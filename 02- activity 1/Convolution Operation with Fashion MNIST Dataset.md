<!-- # Dive into Convolutional Operations: Exploring the Fashion MNIST Dataset -->

## Introduction :pencil2:

This activity will help you practice and assess the knowledge and skills you just learned about convolutional neural networks (CNNs). During your learning journey, itâ€™s crucial to engage with tools that allow you to observe how convolutional operations transform image data. This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of convolution filters and their effects on image processing.

We encourage you to further experiment with different datasets and filters after completing this exercise. This hands-on experience is key to mastering the concepts and applying them in real-world scenarios.

**Note:** There are no pre-defined solutions for this exercise, as the focus is on personal observation and analysis. Take time to compare your results to deepen your understanding of the material.

It is important to understand the reasoning behind your observations in order to improve your own problem-solving abilities.

## Hands-On with Fashion MNIST Dataset

### Instructions

1. **Visit the Convolution Tool:** Navigate to [DeepLizard Convolution Operation App](https://deeplizard.com/resource/pavq7noze2) to access the convolution tool.

2. **Select the Fashion MNIST Dataset:** Choose the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains grayscale images of various clothing items like t-shirts, shoes, and coats.

3. **Pick a Filter:** Select one of the available convolutional filters, such as edge detection, sharpening, or blurring. This filter will be applied to all images in the dataset.

4. **Run the Filter:** Apply the chosen filter to each clothing image in the dataset and observe the transformations.

5. **Take Screenshots:** Capture screenshots of each filtered image to document the results.

6. **Compare Similar Items:** Look at the filtered images of similar items (e.g., compare shoes to shoes or shirts to shirts) and analyze any patterns or similarities.

7.  **Try Out Another Filter:** Try out another filter on just one of the fashion items sample

9. **Document Observations:** Write down your observations regarding how the filter altered the images and whether similar items displayed similar transformations.

1. Edge detection filters can emphasize boundaries and outlines, making it easier to compare structural similarities.
2. Blur filters smooth out details, which can highlight overall shapes but reduce the visibility of finer patterns.
3. Focus on specific features, such as textures or seams, to observe how the filter affects them.

## Reflecting on Your Results

### Instructions

1. **Analyze the Filter's Impact:** Reflect on whether the filter helped you identify similarities between different items. What patterns did you observe? 

2. **Compare Outputs:** Did similar clothing items (e.g., shoes or shirts) share any visual traits after the filter was applied?

3. **Write Your Analysis:** Provide a brief written analysis of the similarities or differences you noticed between the items after applying the convolution filter.

Using the edge detection filter, I noticed that the outlines of t-shirts were clearly highlighted, making it easier to identify items with similar stitching patterns. Shoes had distinct boundaries, with edges around the soles and laces standing out, which allowed me to easily compare different shoe types.
