<!-- # Dive into Convolutional Operations: Exploring the Fashion MNIST Dataset -->
Introduction :pencil2:
This activity will help you apply the knowledge of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and understand how filters work in transforming images. By experimenting with a tool, you’ll get hands-on experience in observing how a single convolutional filter affects different items from the Fashion MNIST dataset.

Practicing with real data and observing the output is an essential part of understanding how CNNs operate. Once you finish this exercise, feel free to explore more datasets and filters to deepen your understanding.

Note: This activity provides guidance on using the convolutional operation tool and making observations. Ensure you engage with the tool and the results, analyzing the output carefully.

It is important to understand the reasoning behind each step to strengthen your problem-solving skills.

Convolution Operation with Fashion MNIST Dataset
Instructions
Visit the Convolution Tool: Navigate to DeepLizard Convolution Operation App to get started.

Choose the Fashion MNIST Dataset: Once on the site, select the Fashion MNIST dataset. This dataset contains grayscale images of various clothing items like t-shirts, shoes, and coats.

Select a Filter: Choose a single convolutional filter (such as edge detection, blur, or sharpening) that you’ll apply to all images in the dataset.

Run the Filter: Apply the selected filter to all sample clothing images in the Fashion MNIST dataset and observe how the images change.

Take Screenshots: Capture screenshots of the output for each clothing item after the filter has been applied.

Compare the Outputs: Look at the outputs of similar clothing items (e.g., compare different shoes or shirts) and see if there are any similarities in the filtered images.

Discussion: Analyze and discuss the following questions:

Do you notice any common patterns or features highlighted by the filter among similar items?
How did the filter impact the visibility of the details in the images (e.g., edges, textures)?

Filters like edge detection emphasize the outlines of objects, making it easier to spot similarities in structure.
Blur filters tend to smooth out details but may highlight overall shapes.
Pay attention to how the filter affects features like seams, collars, and textures on the clothing.

Analyzing Your Outputs
Instructions
Reflect on the Filter’s Effectiveness: Did the filter you chose make it easier to identify similarities between the clothing items? Write down your observations.

Compare Similar Items: For example, compare filtered images of shoes to other shoes and see if similar features (e.g., shape or texture) are emphasized by the filter.

Document Your Observations: Provide a brief written explanation of the similarities or differences you observed between the items after applying the filter.

The edge detection filter highlighted the seams and outlines of t-shirts, making it easier to identify items with similar stitching patterns. Shoes had distinct edges that were clearly visible after filtering, especially the soles and laces, which appeared similar across different types of shoes.
